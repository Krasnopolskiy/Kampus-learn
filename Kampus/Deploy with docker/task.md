## Description

The last stage involves the deployment of the project so that we can provide the final product to a potential customer.
In this project, we will use Docker to deploy the project.

## Objectives

Build an image of each service:

1. Student service:
    - name: `kampus-student-service`
    - version: `1.0.0`
2. Schedule service:
    - name: `kampus-schedule-service`
    - version: `1.0.0`

## Examples

`docker image ls`

```text

kampus-student-service    1.0.0            31c0bfe98db4   53 years ago    286MB
